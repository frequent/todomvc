> jIO is an abstract, promise-based JavaScript API that offers connectors to many storages (Dropbox, Google Drive, IndexedDB…) and special handlers for enhanced functionality (replication, compression, querying…). jIO separates storage access from the application, providing a simple way to switch backends and create offline-capable applications.
